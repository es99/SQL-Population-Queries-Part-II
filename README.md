# SQL-Population-Queries-Part-II

### Project provided by Codecademy.
* Work with a dataset of world population by country data from recent year. I'll write queries
to retrieve interesting data and answer a set of specific questions.

* Obs.: All answers are in the file population_queries.sql


#### 1. How many entries in the database are from Africa?
#### 2. What was the total population of Oceania in 2005?
#### 3. What is the average population of countries in South America in 2003?
#### 4. What country had the smallest population in 2007?
#### 5. What is the average population of Poland during the time period covered by this dataset?
#### 6. How many countries have the word "The" in their name?
#### 7. What was the total population of each continent in 2010?
